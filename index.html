          <div id="doc"><h2 id="whatisprojectintern">What is Project Intern?</h2>
<p>Project Intern is a collection of various initiatives to get more SoC students summer internships with tech companies.  This document/site is one of the initiatives. We hope to consolidate all the information regarding getting an overseas summer internship. With a focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>NUS SoC students</li>
<li>Internships with tech companies in the U.S.<em>[*]</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>[*]</em> We don’t mean to say that there are no interesting internships outside the US - in the past, SoC students have, in fact, interned at companies in Sweden, Canada, Japan and the UK. But the truth is that the biggest and most interesting tech companies are based in the US. Every summer, talent pours into the Valley, with interns taking up apartments and hotels and train stations, filling up hackathons and picnic fields and event halls. (These things happen at other technology centers in the US, of course. But SV is where it’s at).</p>
<p>This means you’ll get to meet some incredibly talented people. It means that you’re probably going to have a lot of fun doing it. And it also means - given that you’ll be spending 3 months in such an environment - that you’ll learn a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>There are two general parts to Project Intern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise awareness about overseas internships</li>
<li>Help students secure overseas internships</li>
</ul>
<p>This document/site will address both issues.</p>
<h2 id="whyasummerinternship">Why a summer internship?</h2>
<p>You’re an undergraduate, and you just survived yet another semester of NUS. You’re probably awaiting your results, and worrying about your CAP, and planning some holiday trip (take your pick: Thailand/Vietnam/Bali) with friends. Why bother doing an internship? </p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons. </p>
<p>A summer internship is a 3 month stint at a company. During which you’ll essentially be working as you would a real job. An internship with a large company in the valley pays USD$7000-USD$8000 (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Palantir), with free lodging, food, bikes, laptops, etc depending on the company and ridiculousness of the recruiting department. An internship with a valley startup pays USD$3000 - USD$8000, depending on the stage of the startup, and your role. Of course, only the more established ones (e.g. Quora) can afford to match the compensation of the larger companies.</p>
<p>So <strong>reason 1</strong>: you’ll earn a lot. Way more than if you spend your parent’s money in Bali. (Well, you’ll still be spending money - cough, Amazon Prime cough - but at least it’s yours).</p>
<p>Money is not a good enough reason, though. There are other more important reasons. We cover some of the more obvious ones here:</p>
<p><strong>Reason 2</strong>: you’ll learn a lot
If you want to be good at what you do, you better optimize for learning. Scoring an internship forces you to <em>become</em> good at the fundamentals of Computer Science. Interning in the valley, with some of the brightest people in computing, will teach you way more about the industry and computer science than studying books alone ever will. </p>
<p>Practically speaking, what this feels like is that you’ll now return to school with context for all the things your Professors are teaching you. You’ll find more things interesting and useful. You’ll see why Machine Learning is hot, even if the equations your professor throws on the board are anything but. You might even begin reading papers, hoping to collect as many good ideas for technical projects in the future. </p>
<p><strong>Reason 3</strong>: you’ll get to try out what you actually do after graduation
A tech internship is essentially a trial for what working full-time at the company is like. You spend three months discovering what works for you. The best part is, if you like it, you’ll already have a foot in the door at the company, or any other company for that matter. Imagine what having Google, Microsoft, Facebook or any other tech company on your resume will do for you.</p>
<p><strong>Reason 4</strong>: you’ll have a ton of fun
There are plenty of places to go in the US, and too many things to do. Be it shopping discounted designer goods at Gilroy, wine tasting at Napa, fruit picking at Portola Valley, visiting the MoMA, skydiving, hacking at the hackathon of the week (there is one every week, trust us), or hiking at Yosemite - you’ll be spoilt for choice. Doing an overseas internship is like doing an exchange, with the exception that you get paid to do it -and there is no studying involved.-</p>
<h3 id="whoshiring">Who’s hiring?</h3>
<p>The following list of companies have at some point taken interns from NUS.<em>[*]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Microsoft</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Palantir</li>
<li>Quora</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>_[*]_Taking international interns is harder for companies as they have to deal with the visa process and it costs more to fly you over and house you.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t just restrict yourself to the companies here though. Applying to multiple companies greatly increases your odds of getting an offer (since tech companies are notorious for the false negatives in their recruitment process).</p>
<h2 id="therecruitmentprocess">The Recruitment Process</h2>
<p>The recruitment process process differs from company to company, though they overlap somewhat. Here is an overview of the typical recruitment process:</p>
<h3 id="overviewofthetypicalrecruitmentprocess">Overview of the typical recruitment process</h3>
<h4 id="1submitresumemakingcontact">1. Submit resume (making contact)</h4>
<p>This is the first step you need to take. Whether it’s sending your resume, getting a referral, or contacting a recruiter. Many people don’t even get to doing this. They think that they don’t stand a chance and so they don’t even bother trying.</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t make contact, you are never going to get recruited.</strong></p>
<h4 id="2recruiterpicksyourresumeandmakesfirstcontact">2. Recruiter picks your resume and makes first contact.</h4>
<p>There is usually a long and painful wait between the first step and this one. Most people don’t even hear from the recruiters. Just imagine the number of resumes the recruiters receive and the number which they are physically capable of responding to. So don’t lose heart if you don’t hear from the them. <em>Fix</em> your resume and try again.</p>
<h4 id="3phonescreen">3. Phone screen</h4>
<p>You can think of the phone screen as a watered down technical interview. It is less demanding and usually way less technical. This round is meant to weed out the people who look good on paper but really should not proceed any further.</p>
<h4 id="4technicalinterviews">4. Technical Interviews</h4>
<p>You generally get at least 2 interviewers here. Each lasting for about an hour. Possibly over skype/phone and an online collaborative document where you are expected to code.</p>
<p>Most people fail here due to a lack of preparation.</p>
<p>(See below for more details about technical interviews and what to expect.)</p>
<h4 id="5onsiteinterviewsvariesfromcompanytocompany">5. Onsite Interviews (varies from company to company)</h4>
<p>Some companies have these. Some only do this for full time recruitment. Some companies fly their engineers down to interview a group of people instead of flying everyone there. It&#39;s different everywhere.</p>
<h4 id="6offer">6. Offer</h4>
<p>Great, you made it. Its time to decide if you want to take the offer from the company. You might want to think about the following things before you put your signature on the piece of paper. This applies even more so when you have more than one offer on the table.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product</strong>. What product will you be working on? Are you excited about it?</li>
<li><strong>Compensation</strong>. Don’t forget to factor in taxes, housing, food, cost of living and other factors besides the absolute paycheck. These things add up.</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>. This really boils down to personal preferences. Assuming its an internship in the U.S, you might want to try a different city if you’ve already been in one the previous summer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whentoapply">When to apply</h3>
<p><strong>Start early.</strong></p>
<p>As you would imagine, summer internships are highly sought after. You’ll be competing with students from all over the world. Applications start as early as the fall (once the summer ends) and spots get taken over time. The latest you can probably expect to get an offer is one month before the summer. Though that is the exception. The later it gets, the less openings there’ll be, both within the company and within the teams. Naturally, the more attractive companies and teams are the first to go.<em>[*]</em></p>
<p>_[*]_Think Google X or Microsoft Research Intern.</p>
<h3 id="theresume">The Resume</h3>
<p>This is one of the biggest barriers faced by students. We literally have nothing relevant to put to get the recruiter’s attention. The good news is, that everyone if in the same boat, or at least the people trying to secure their first internship. The key point to note here is that <strong>tech resumes differ from normal resumes.</strong></p>
<p>The following resources best explain how to get your resume right:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="technicalinterviews">Technical Interviews</h3>
<p>It will be expected of candidates to have the following set of knowledge (non exhaustive list):</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic programming skills (able to write code)</li>
<li>Appreciation for computation semantics - primitives, combination, abstractions, even if implicitly</li>
<li>Algorithms and Data structures - you’re expected to have completed and have scored well in the algorithms and data structures course, or have the equivalent knowledge </li>
<li>Sensibility in systems design and database design - understanding the tradeoffs</li>
<li>Know at least one programming language well, and ability to pick up a new language on the fly</li>
<li>Basic knowledge in logic, formal systems, and proof systems</li>
<li>General problem solving skills</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conduct">Conduct</h4>
<p>The conduct of a technical interview varies from company to company. In general, the established companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) will have an established system of interviews and is a lot more predictable and consistent. The interviews you get at the smaller companies (Startups, even Facebook) is highly contingent on the engineers you get as your interviewer. However, there are some common patterns for a technical interview.</p>
<p>Interviews can either be conducted physically, or through a skype / conference call with the possible aid of an online collaborative editing tool like Google Docs or Stypi. Depending on how the interview is conducted, you may face several interviewers in one day, or have several rounds of interviews with an interviewer each. Most interviews will be no more than an hour long.</p>
<p>There are 3 major types of question an interviewer may ask:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Design</strong> - you’ll be asked how you’d design a particular feature (the backend, the database etc.). For instance, you may be asked how you would implement a simplified version of Facebook’s news feed.</li>
<li><strong>Coding Question</strong> - You will be given a problem and you’ll be asked to implement the solution. While algorithmic questions are highly likely, an ad hoc type of question may also be possible. Sometimes an interviewer wants to assess your basic coding ability or your familiarity with one specific programming language that you may have claimed you were familiar with (e.g a pointer specific question in C/C++).</li>
<li><strong>Test Question</strong> - You may be asked how you’d test a particular feature or code.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have to be mindful of the following:</p>
<p><strong>There are usually trade-offs involved</strong></p>
<p>The aim of the interviewers is to assess your competency as an engineer in the short amount of time they have. Part of engineering is understanding and being able to weigh trade-offs involved in engineering decisions. For instance, you may be asked to implement an abstract data-type that can store data (perhaps something that emulates the behavior of an array). You may simply start with an array, to which you face a problem when your static array runs out of size. You may then change it to a linked-list, and you realize there are issues with fragmentations. Here, there are trade-offs and while the interviewer may guide you through it, it helps if you are mindful of them to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Making Assumptions</strong></p>
<p>Be mindful of the assumptions you’re making. This applies to all types of problems (design, coding, etc.) For instance, when asked to implement a routine, it may be convenient to make assumptions like the validity of the argument values passed in. While this is generally a reasonable assumption to make, it doesn’t hurt to check and to practise defensive coding in your implementation.</p>
<p><strong>The flow of the interview</strong></p>
<p>Again, the emphasis is about assessing your competency as an engineer. As such, the interview may change depending on the answers you make and even the questions you ask. For instance, you may be asked to implement a routine that checks the validity of parentheses (e.g <code>()()((()))</code> is valid but <code>())</code> is not. It is conceivable that you may think of using regular expressions, and usually an interviewer will just go with the flow just to see how you’ll solve it using regular expressions, even if the original intention was not to use regular expression. That said, you’re still expected to be aware of the trade-offs involved (speed, memory, conciseness of code, testability etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Do NOT claim that you’re competent in anything</strong></p>
<p>First, it’s an issue of humility. Show passion, but not arrogance. And know your place. Next, it’ll be extremely embarrassing if you had said that you were familiar with, for instance, C++, and screw up on a basic coding problem using C++.</p>
<p><strong>Simple problems</strong></p>
<p>Do not underestimate problems that appear simple. Always assume that the interviewer is an experienced interviewer, and has a specific intent in giving you this problem. It may be that there are corner case traps that you were not careful of, or that there are even more efficient solutions that you did not think of. It could also be that the interviewer wants to see how elegant your coding is. For instance, the parenthesis problem above is considered a very simple coding exercise, but an inept programmer will end up writing unnecessarily tedious, long and messy code. For after all, much of a software engineer’s work is to implement routines and modules that are not that complicated, but in an elegant, concise and maintainable manner.</p>
<p>That said, do not overthink when given a simple problem. It could simply be a warm-up problem or a necessary building block to other problems.</p>
<p><strong>Think aloud, and have a conversation with your interviewer</strong></p>
<p>Do not rush into the solution. Plan and think through the problem. It helps if you allow your interviewer know your thought process. The whole interview should be seen as a conversation with the interviewer and to allow him/her to understand you better. When you’re stuck, don’t be too afraid of asking for help (of course, you should spend some time thinking through the problem yourself first).</p>
<p>Typically (in a face to face interview) there will be a whiteboard. Use that whiteboard as your scratch area to brainstorm and think aloud. Use visual aids to have a discussion with your interviewer on why you think a particular problem should be solved a certain way.</p>
<h2 id="howtoprimeyourselfforaninternship">How to prime yourself for an Internship</h2>
<p>It can be pretty daunting. For some of you, you’ve just started computing/programming. You are probably thinking about how you can keep up with everyone else. Well, the good news is that <a href="http://rahulbijlani.com/essays/you-are-not-running-out-of-time-essay/">you are not running out of time</a>. Its not too late to start now, and you certainly can become good enough to get an internship.</p>
<p>For a start, read this document:
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FbCWcnnajHWk594dKmN35b_we50WZf_-cwxqg-cYaRY/edit">Notes to Computer Science Freshmen, From The Future.</a></p>
<p>Welcome back. If you didn’t read the document and just stepped over the link above, you really should. The document contains information that students, like yourself,  wished they knew.</p>
<p>The document provides a nice basis for this section. It covers advice on how to do well in SoC, or Computer Science in general. Most of which is highly relevant if you want to do an internship at a tech company. After all, if you are doing well, you chances of getting that internship you dream about get that much higher.</p>
<h3 id="nussocspecificadvice">NUS SoC Specific Advice</h3>
<h4 id="mandatorymodulestotakeseriously">Mandatory Modules to take seriously</h4>
<p>The following CS modules are mandatory for all students. Yet, it is easy to neglect them and/or not give them as much attention as they deserve. <em>Many students mistakenly think that, for instance, discrete math is a waste of time and completely irrelevant to programming and so they take it less seriously.</em></p>
<h5 id="cs1231discretestructures">CS1231 - Discrete Structures</h5>

<h4 id="optionalmodulestotake">Optional Modules to take</h4>
<h5 id="cs1101sprogrammingmethodology">CS1101S - Programming Methodology</h5>
<p>In your first semester, you get a choice between CS1010 and CS1101S. <strong>Take the latter</strong>. No seriously.</p>

<h4 id="otherthingstodo">Other things to do</h4>
<h5 id="teachbecomeateachingassistantifyoucan">Teach. Become a teaching assistant if you can</h5>
<h3 id="whatcompanieslookforinyourresume">What companies look for in your resume</h3>
<h4 id="gradesemexactlyhowimportantisyourgpaem">Grades. <em>Exactly how important is your GPA?</em></h4>
<p>It is hard to measure. Most of the recruiters are familiar with a US GPA system which is out of 4.0 but NUS’s GPA is out of 5.0. That said, this is most likely not the most important factor.</p>
<p>Your grades should be good. After all, it’s one of the signals recruiters use to tell <em>if you know your stuff, albeit a pretty flawed one.</em> That being said, your absolute CAP is way less important to the companies than the other skills mentioned.</p>
<p>Your CAP is probably only going to be useful in the early stages of the recruitment process. Even then, there are other ways, better ways, to make your resume stand out.</p>
<h4 id="sideprojects">Side Projects</h4>
<p>We can’t stress the importance of this enough. Unless you’ve somehow manage to prove that you can program (Winning Informatics Olympiad for instance), this is your best bet in showing the companies you can.</p>
<p>Being in college, your resume is probably empty or filled with irrelevant experience like National Service, being a Student Leader in some organisation, Community service etc. Not to downplay these achievements, (which you should definitely put on your resume as they speak of your other qualities) but companies aren’t exactly going to hire you to be a software engineer based solely on these qualities.</p>
<p>No. They are looking for evidence that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can code</li>
<li>You are passionate about what you are doing</li>
<li>You are able to learn stuff on you own</li>
</ul>
<p>Side projects are the best way to do all three. Plus, they have the added bonus having great learning value. Think of something, build it. Better yet, learn git, version control your code, and share it on github. See <a href="https://github.com/ahbeng/NUSMods">nusmods.com</a> for a great example of a side project. You’ll probably use it soon or already have.</p>
<h3 id="preparingforthetechnicalinterview">Preparing for the technical interview</h3>
<p>This section is misleading. It suggests you can somehow, in a short period of time, get ready for the interview. Well, unless you already have a firm grasp of the knowledge and a mastery of the skills that follows, you probably need more time.</p>
<p><strong>You <em>don’t</em> start preparing for technical interviews when you know you have one coming up.</strong></p>
<p>Some things like data structures and algorithms knowledge, problem solving skills and coding proficiency take time to build up. You’ll probably need more than a few months to get significantly better at this, so start early, and do it consistently. Practice makes perfect. The best part is that the skills are useful beyond just the technical interviews.</p>
